Spectrometer EPICS module
==========================

An epics support module for spectrometers (yep, you guessed it)

This module includes the SeaBreeze source code (see below).

To add this module to an IOC application:
    - Add release path to configure/RELEASE
    - Add to src/Makefile:
        $(PROD_NAME)_DBD += base.dbd
        $(PROD_NAME)_DBD += asyn.dbd
        $(PROD_NAME)_DBD += spectrometer.dbd
        #
        $(PROD_NAME)_LIBS += seabreeze
        $(PROD_NAME)_LIBS += spectrometer
        $(PROD_NAME)_LIBS += asyn
        $(PROD_NAME)_SYS_LIBS_Linux += usb
    - For ocean optics spectrometers, optionally install db files, e.g.:
        DB_INSTALLS += $(SPECTROMETER)/db/seabreezeAPI.template

SeaBreeze

Open-source C/C++ API for select Ocean Optics USB spectrometers.

For more info see:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/seabreeze/
https://www.oceaninsight.com/globalassets/catalog-blocks-and-images/software-downloads-installers/javadocs-api/seabreeze/html/index.html

Cross-compilation of source code is currently not supported.
Building on windows is not supported.

External dependencies:
libusb-0.1
Be sure to include the libusb-0.1 library in your IOC application.  For example, in src/Makefile:
myApp_SYS_LIBS_Linux += usb

There are examples and test programs here:
seabreezeSupport/vendor/SeaBreeze/sample-code/
seabreezeSupport/vendor/SeaBreeze/test/

There is a udev rule here:
seabreezeSupport/vendor/SeaBreeze/os-support/linux/

To upgrade the source code, download the latest version from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/seabreeze/files/latest/download
Then unzip and drop the contents of the seabreeze-<version> directory into $(TOP)/seabreezeSupport/vendor/ and rebuild.

Note regarding seabreeze API and EPICS drivers:
    There are two different versions of the API and thus two different EPICS drivers:
        1) SeaBreezeAPI (newer) --> drvSeaBreezeAPI
        2) SeaBreezeWrapper (older) --> drvSeaBreezeWrapper
    Try the newer driver first.  If this does not work with your particular device, try the older one.
    For more see:
        https://www.oceaninsight.com/globalassets/catalog-blocks-and-images/software-downloads-installers/javadocs-api/seabreeze/html/index.html

CAUTION: Some functions in the seabreeze API are not thread safe.
    This can crash the IOC when running multiple spectrometers per IOC.
    A single spectrometer per IOC ensures maximum reliability.
